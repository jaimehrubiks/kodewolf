**Hello !** My name is Alexis 'fuego' Tacnet, and this is my blog. I'm a 20 years old student
interested in **coding**, **devops**, **machine learning** and **cool stuff**.

I love to code in **Python** and to travel a lot.

I live in France, if you're near me don't hesitate to say hi ! I love **friends** and **beer**.
