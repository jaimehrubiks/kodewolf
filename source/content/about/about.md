Hi ! My name is Alexis ***fuego*** Tacnet, and this is my blog. I'm a 20 years old student who loves to code and to learn how things work. I also describe myself as a casual sysadmin, a apprentice data scientist and a learning designer.

I love to code in **Python** and to travel a lot.

I live in France, if you're near me don't hesitate to say hi ! I love friends and beer.
