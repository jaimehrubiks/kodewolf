Hi ! My name is Alexis '***fuego***' Tacnet, and this is my blog. I'm a developer and student at Centrale Paris, but also a traveler and a fan of design. I love to code in **Python**, especially about machine learning.

I live in France, if you're near me don't hesitate to say hi ! I love friends and beer.
