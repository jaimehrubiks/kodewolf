Hi ! I love to travel a lot, and I never leave without my **backpack**, full of stuff I love to take with me on roads.

This is a list about everything I take with me : tech gear, books, ... I will complete it when I found something !

# The day-to-day backpack

![Stuff](/images/stuff.png)

For my personnal and professional use, I need _must-have_ stuff like :

* A **HP Probook 4540s**, a small computer and quite old, but that still works. I can't recommend you to buy one because there are much recent laptop at the same price. And the **D-Link DWA-171** I bought because of the wireless chipset inside.
* A **Huawei Ascend Mate 7**, a really good smartphone ! It is still on Android 4.4 but I love it anyway.

And for my personnal life, here is things I like and take everywhere with me :

* An **Astro A40** headset, quite old too. I bought it when I was playing video games, but it still sounds really great.
* A **JBL** pair of earpods, for when I don't want to use big headphones.
* A **Sony SRS X55** bluetooth speaker : a must for me. There is a jack input too and a USB output to charge my smartphone !
* A **Fitbit Charge HR** to track my hearth rate and the number of hours I sleep.
* Pencils and a notebook to take ideas !

Finally, some cool stuf I take often :

* A **CommitStrip** book, because it is very funny to read : CommitStrip is a strip book about coders and their cool life.
* A **Zero to One** book, a good one I'm reading currently about launching startups, written by the founder of Paypal.

I take all of this inside a **Herschel** backpack, with a **Lancaster** wallet !
