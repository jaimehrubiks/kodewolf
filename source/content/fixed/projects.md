[**Amiral**](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/amiral) is a bot designed to help developpers in their day-to-day life. It alerts when a build is done, when something isn't right and will use Natural Language Processing to understand properly its master. It can also work in team, alerting everybody when a maintenance is scheluded or when somebody needs help.

This project is **only at its beginning** so everything is not implemented yet, but I will work on it.

**Lupus**, a game based on _The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow_ designed for the Campus of Ecole Centrale Paris. There is a simple website to present the game, sources at [this address](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-website) and a web app developped in ReactJS, available [here](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-front-web). The back has to be done and will be in Python with Flask.

If you have any questions about them, don't hesitate, I would be happy to help :)
