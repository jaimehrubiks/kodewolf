Hey ! You can checkout my **projects** here : 

* On _Github_ : [https://github.com/fuegowolf](https://github.com/fuegowolf) 
* On _Helios_, my own Git server : [https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego)

And you will find all of them here :

[![Frostfire](/images/frostfire.png)](https://github.com/fuegowolf/frostfire)

[**Frostfire**](https://github.com/fuegowolf/frostfire) is a Docker stack for people who want a private server for their projects and entertainment. Frostfire contains a modular Nginx to host all kinds of projects, a Graylog stack to monitor logs, a Telegraf/InfluxDB/Grafana stack to monitor metrics, a Continuous Deployment environment, a Taiga to manage projects, a Gogs git server to host private projects, a Deluge, a Pydio, and more…

All is here to exploit the maximum of a private server : tools to host and develop personnal or team projects, as well as personnal tools.

[![Amiral](/images/amiral.png)](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/amiral)

[**Amiral**](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/amiral) is a bot designed to help developpers in their day-to-day life. It alerts them when a build is done, when something isn't right and will use Natural Language Processing to properly understand its master. It can also work in team, alerting everybody when maintenance is scheluded or when somebody needs help.

This project is **only at its beginning** so everything is not implemented yet, but I will work on it.

[![Kodewolf](/images/kodewolf.png)](https://kodewolf.com)

[**Kodewolf**](https://kodewolf.com) is my blog. It is where I describe my personal experiences in coding, machine learning and other cool stuff I found on the net or I discussed with my friends.

![Lupus](/images/lupus.png)

**Lupus**, a game based on _The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow_ designed for the Campus of Ecole Centrale Paris. There is a simple website to present the game, with sources at [this address](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-website) and a web app developped in ReactJS, available [here](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-front-web). The back has yet to be done and will be in Python with Flask.

If you have any questions about them, don't hesitate to ask, I would be happy to help :)
