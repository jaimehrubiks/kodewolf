Hey ! You can checkout my **projects** on GitHub here : [https://github.com/fuegowolf](https://github.com/fuegowolf) or on my own Git server : [https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego)! You will find every of them :

* [**Kodewolf**](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/kodewolf), this blog.
* [**Frostfire**](https://github.com/fuegowolf/frostfire), my online base. It is a stack with many features, all with Docker.
* [**Chessto**](https://github.com/fuegowolf/chessto), a chess board with a powerful API, to control a chess game with computers and experiment a lot.
* [**Lupus**](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-front-web), a game based on Werewolves designed for the Campus of Ecole Centrale Paris.
* [**Amiral**](https://github.com/fuegowolf/amiral), my personnal companion. He is a bot that checkouts everything for me and keeps me up.

If you have any questions about them, don't hesitate, I would be happy to help :)
