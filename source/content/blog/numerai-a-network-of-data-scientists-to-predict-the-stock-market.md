[**Numerai**](https://numer.ai) is a website about **Machine Learning**. Well, no surprise, the topic is sky-rocketing in the world of IT nowadays.

But here, it is about **Stock Market**, a dream for a lot of data scientists : many features, predictions that matter (the more accurate you predict, the more you earn money) and, without hiding ourselves, being able to say to your step-parents asking for your job _Well I'm predicting the stock market you know_.

# A tale about the Stock Market

Once upon a time, a man wondered what made predictions in Machine Learning so accurate on some topics. He noticed that everything has been a matter of **publishing the data**. Nothing beats the entire world community on a dataset, best predictions only come from world-wide participation.

However, the stock market is some what special. Datasets are higly valuable so each financial company is protecting its data, and if you manage to build a really strong model, you will certainly keep it for yourself ! So this man was facing a huge issue : how to make the world work on the stock market dataset without giving it to everybody ?

The clever guy found a solution:  **Cryptography**. Encryption tools which conserve additions and multiplications have been meanwhile discovered, so came the idea of an encrypted dataset that still would gather meaningful features and give rise to relevant predictions. Everybody was now able to take part without the real and sensitive dataset.

# Let's go

Nothing else was needed to launch **Numerai**, a place where the best data scientists are working on improving predictions about the stock market. The organization is using **stacking** to combine all predictions from everybody and aims to have the best model possible.

Stacking is about having a _meta model_ which takes in input all predictions of everybody and give them a weight according to the improvement they give to the global model. If I submit a model that is, in a good way, radically different from others, I may improve a lot the Numerai's model for example.

# Why predict the stock market ?

There is an obvious financial aspect behind predicting the financial field, but it still can be more than that. Everybody is winning when the stock market is predictable, because resources will be allocated perfectly forever. Comes then the ethic :  Is the South going to benefit from this ? Will a financial company buy the organization ? It has to become a problematic people should really think about.

# Money money money

As I presented it, predictions of the stock market can be high valuable, and Numerai is not hiding its meta model predictions. They sell them to financial companies and distribute the money they earn to best models : the more your model is helping the meta model to get closer to reality, the more you will be rewarded.

A leaderboard is also available on the front page : [Numerai](https://numer.ai), if you want to know more about it.

There is currently no limitation to sign up, so do not ditch because your vision, that may be totally different from others, may improve by far what they already succeeded to build. I will personnaly give it a shot, trying to elaborate strong models, but I know how challenging this will be ...

See ya !
