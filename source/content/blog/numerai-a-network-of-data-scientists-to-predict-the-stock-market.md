[**Numerai**](https://numer.ai) is a website about **Machine Learning**. Not a surprise, this subject is sky-rocketing in the IT world nowadays.

But here, it is about **Stock Market**, a dream for a lot of data scientists : many features, predictions that matter (the accurate you predict, the more you earn money) and a cool sentence to say at dinner table : _Well I'm predicting the stock market you know_.

# A tale about the Stock Market

Once upon a time, a man wondering what made predictions in Machine Learning so accurate on some subjects. He notices that everything has been a matter of **publishing the data**. Nothing beats the entire world community on a dataset, best predictions only come from a massive participation.

But the stock market is a special subject to do machine learning on. Datasets are higly valuable so each financial company is protecting its data, and if you manage to build a really strong model you will keep it for you ! So this man was facing a huge issue : how to make the world work on the stock market dataset without giving it to everybody ?

The solution was to use **Cryptography** : encryption tools which conserve additions and multiplications have been discovered, so a encrypted dataset can be shared with the world without breaking features and predictions. Everybody is now able to participate without the real dataset.

# Let's go

Nothing else was needed to launch **Numerai**, a place where the best data scientists are working on improving predictions about the stock market. The organization is using **stacking** to combine all predictions from everybody and have the best model possible.

Stacking is a about having a _meta model_ which takes in input all predictions of everybody and give them a weight according to the improvement they give to the global model. If I submit a model that is radically different from others, in a good way, I will improve a lot the Numerai's model for example.

# Why predict the stock market ?

There is an obvious financial aspect behind predicting the financial field, but it can be more than that. Everybody is winning when the stock market is predictable, because resources will be allocated perfectly forever. There is quite a question of ethic here, is the South going to profit from this ? Will a financial company buy all of this ? Everybody has to think about it.

# Money money money

As I said : predictions of the stock market can be high valuable, and Numerai isn't keeping secret its meta model predictions. They sell them to financial companies and distribute the money they earn to best models : the more your model is helping the meta model to go in the right direction, the more you will earn money.

A leaderboard is available on the front page : [Numerai](https://numer.ai), if you want to know more.

Sign ups are open so don't hesitate, maybe your vision will improve a lot what they have currently. I will try myself to elaborate strong models, but it will be difficult I think ...

See ya !
