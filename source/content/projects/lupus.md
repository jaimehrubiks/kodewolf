**Lupus**, a game based on _The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow_ designed for the Campus of Ecole Centrale Paris. There is a simple website to present the game, with sources at [this address](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-website) and a web app developped in ReactJS, available [here](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/lupus-front-web). The back has yet to be done and will be in Python with Flask.
