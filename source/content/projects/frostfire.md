[**Frostfire**](https://github.com/fuegowolf/frostfire) is a Docker stack for people who want a private server for their projects and entertainment. Frostfire contains a modular Nginx to host all kinds of projects, a Graylog stack to monitor logs, a Telegraf/InfluxDB/Grafana stack to monitor metrics, a Continuous Deployment environment, a Taiga to manage projects, a Gogs git server to host private projects, a Deluge, a Pydio, and moreâ€¦

All is here to exploit the maximum of a private server : tools to host and develop personnal or team projects, as well as personnal tools.
