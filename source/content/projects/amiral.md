[**Amiral**](https://helios.fuegowolf.me/fuego/amiral) is a bot designed to help developpers in their day-to-day life. It alerts them when a build is done, when something isn't right and will use Natural Language Processing to properly understand its master. It can also work in team, alerting everybody when maintenance is scheluded or when somebody needs help.

This project is **only at its beginning** so everything is not implemented yet, but I will work on it.
