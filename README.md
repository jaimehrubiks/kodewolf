Kodewolf is here to provide a quality blog to describe my life and my machine learning/computers experiences. The main goal of this is to create a environnement to relax and learn paisibly what computers are capable of.

It's working with two docker images : 

* One for generating the static HTLM5 website : Hugo
* One for serving the website with class : Nginx

The first time, the Hugo image has to be run to remplace default nginx index page.
